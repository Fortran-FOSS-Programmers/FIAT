This library aims to implement various common data structures
in Fortran.
These will be implemented in a generic manner using a `container` type. This
was originally developed in [PolyCon](https://github.com/cmacmackin/PolyCon),
but has since been folded into FIAT, with some improvements. See the
wiki for a list of data structures which are to be implemented and information
for those wishing to contribute. Also take a look at the
[API documentation](http://fortran-foss-programmers.github.io/FIAT/)
for a detailed description of the methods which will be supported.
