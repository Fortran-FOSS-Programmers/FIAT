  !! Provides an abstract container derived type which can be used

  !! in order to hold different data-types. See [[container]] for 
  !! instructions on creating concrete subclasses. See [[container_mod]]
  !! for subclasses containing the built-in data-types.

    !!
    !! An abstract derived type which contains data. This type can be
    !! used for a sort of unlimited polymorphism. It is extended to
    !! create different classes capable of holding particular 
    !! data-types. Extensions must implement the procedure 
    !! [[container:typeguard]] in order to provide the ability to
    !! transfer data out of the container and into a variable. Assuming
    !! that you are creating a concrete class called 
    !! `example_container`, this should be implemented as follows:
    !!
    !!```fortran
    !! module example_container_mod
    !! 
    !!   use abstract_container_mod
    !!   implicit none
    !!   private
    !! 
    !!   type example
    !!     integer, public :: i
    !!   end type example
    !! 
    !!   type, extends(container) :: example_container
    !!   contains
    !!     private
    !!     procedure :: typeguard => example_guard
    !!   end type example_container
    !! 
    !! contains
    !! 
    !!   logical function example_guard(this, lhs) result(ret)
    !!     class(example_container), intent(in) :: this
    !!     class(*), intent(inout) :: lhs
    !!     select type(lhs)
    !!       type is(example)
    !!         lhs = transfer(this%contents(), lhs)
    !!         ret = .true.
    !!       class default
    !!         ret = .false.
    !!     end select
    !!   end function example_guard
    !!

    !! @Warning During the initial phase of writing unit tests for the

    !! various experiments which involved moving the code around, it
    !! stopped doing this when I changed it back. I have no idea why
    !! it works now and suspect that this is a bug with gfortran 5.3.0.
