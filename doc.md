author_description: I am a graduate student at the University of Oxford, studying the melting and evolution of ice shelves. I enjoy programming, with my favourite languages being Fortran (for numerical work), Vala (for object-oriented programming and anything involving a GUI), and Python (for scripting and everything else).
